# AuraMed - AI Health Assistant

**Developed by Akash S**

## üöÄ Overview

AuraMed is a futuristic, AI-powered health assistant designed to provide intelligent, accessible, and multilingual health information. It combines a sophisticated user interface with the power of the Google Gemini API to offer three distinct modes of operation: Triage, Pharmacy, and Precautions.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Multi-Modal Input**: Interact with AuraMed using text, pill images, or voice-to-text dictation.
- **Three Core AI Modes**:
    1.  **Triage**: Describe symptoms or upload prescription images to receive an AI-driven triage analysis, including urgency level, recommendations, and potential drug interactions.
    2.  **Pharmacy**: Identify medications from text or pill photos. Get detailed information on uses, dosage, side effects, and crucial warnings.
    3.  **Precautions (RAG-Powered)**: Ask for preventative advice on any disease and receive reliable, accurate tips grounded in a curated knowledge base.
- **Advanced Multilingual Support**: The entire user interface and all AI responses are available in English, Spanish, and French.
- **On-Demand Translation**: Instantly translate any AI-generated report into Kannada, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, or Malayalam.
- **Natural Text-to-Speech**: Make information more accessible with a high-quality, human-like voice that reads results aloud in your selected language, speaking in natural sections for better comprehension.
- **Futuristic UI/UX**: A stunning, modern interface featuring an animated aurora background, sleek glassmorphism effects, and fluid animations for an engaging user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **AI Backend**: Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash`)
- **Architecture**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for the Precautions mode.
- **Browser APIs**:
    - Web Speech API (for voice-to-text)
    - Web Speech Synthesis API (for text-to-speech)

## üß† RAG Architecture (Precautions Mode)

To ensure the highest level of accuracy and reliability, AuraMed's "Precautions" mode is powered by a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline. This advanced architecture grounds the AI's responses in a curated, internal knowledge base, minimizing hallucinations and providing trustworthy health information.

### How It Works:

1.  **User Query**: The user asks for precautions for a specific condition (e.g., "precautions for hypertension").
2.  **Retrieve**: A client-side RAG service performs a keyword search against a local, curated **Knowledge Base** (`services/knowledgeBase.ts`) to find the most relevant health document.
3.  **Augment**: The retrieved document's content is injected directly into a specialized system prompt for the Gemini model. The AI is explicitly instructed to base its answer *primarily* on this provided context.
4.  **Generate**: The Gemini model processes the augmented prompt and generates a structured, reliable response that adheres to the curated information.

This process ensures that the advice provided is not just generated, but is **retrieved, verified, and then articulated** by the AI.

## üí° How to Use

1.  **Select a Mode**: Use the intuitive switcher in the header to choose between `Triage`, `Pharmacy`, or `Precautions`.
2.  **Choose a Language**: Select your preferred language for the interface and AI responses.
3.  **Interact**:
    - Type your query in the input box.
    - Click the paperclip icon to upload an image (e.g., a prescription or a pill).
    - Click the microphone icon to speak your query.
4.  **Review the Results**: AuraMed will provide a structured, detailed analysis in a custom card.
5.  **Translate & Listen**: Use the controls on the result card to translate the information into various languages or have it read aloud.
